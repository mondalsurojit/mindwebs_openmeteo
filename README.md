# Weather Forecast Visualization Platform

**Live Demo**: [https://mindwebs-openmeteo.vercel.app](https://mindwebs-openmeteo.vercel.app)  
**GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/mondalsurojit/mindwebs_openmeteo](https://github.com/mondalsurojit/mindwebs_openmeteo)

## üìå Overview

This is a React-based geospatial web application that visualizes high-resolution weather forecasts (e.g., temperature) using an interactive map built with Leaflet. The app is designed to help users explore spatial-temporal weather data in an intuitive and scalable way.

The application also integrates the WRF model output for a particular timestamp, on which 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The application currently displays only static OpenMeteo forecast data, directly loaded in the frontend.
To visualize high-resolution WRF model outputs (up to 1 sq. km), the backend needs to be activated. While it is not currently active, it can be enabled if required.

## üß† Design / Development Remarks

- The map displays forecast layers like temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind using preloaded static JSON data (for WRF model).  temperature (for OpenMeteo).
- A layer switcher allows toggling between variables.
- Custom legends are generated dynamically based on selected layers.
- The UI is mobile-responsive, minimal, and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- The codebase is modular, separating map logic, legends, and controls into clean React components.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Backend Context (Not Deployed)

A backend (currently inactive) was developed to:

- Fetch and preprocess WRF model outputs from IIT Hyderabad‚Äôs pipeline
- Convert model data to frontend-compatible JSON formats
- Serve it via a REST API using Django

This integration is planned for future deployment.
